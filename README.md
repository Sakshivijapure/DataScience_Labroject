Project Title: Stock Market Trend Analysis and Price Forecasting using Python

Brief Description:
This project analyzes the historical stock data of 10 major NIFTY 50 companies to identify market trends, visualize performance, and forecast future prices using machine learning. It implements essential data science steps such as data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, visualization, and prediction using a Linear Regression model.

The project concludes with an interactive Streamlit dashboard that allows users to view stock trends, compare companies, and see predicted future prices. This project demonstrates how data science techniques can be used to make informed financial insights.
